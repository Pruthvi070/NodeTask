# User Task Queuing with Rate Limiting

## Project Overview
This project implements a user task queuing system with rate limiting using Node.js, Express, Redis, and Bull. It enables users to submit tasks while enforcing limits on the number of tasks each user can submit within a specified time frame. If a user exceeds the rate limit, their task is queued for later execution, ensuring that no requests are dropped.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pruthvi070/NodeTask.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) installed on your machine. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   PORT=3000
   RATE_LIMIT_POINTS=20  # Max 20 tasks per minute per user
   RATE_LIMIT_DURATION=60  # Duration for rate limit in seconds
   TASK_DELAY_MS=1000  # Delay in ms for tasks that exceed rate limit
   ```

4. **Start Redis Server**:
   Ensure your Redis server is running. You can start it using the command:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

## Usage Instructions
To run the server and make requests:

1. **Start the Server**:
   In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Making Requests**:
   You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` to make POST requests to the server.

   **POST Request Example**:
   URL: `http://localhost:3000/task`

   **JSON Body**:
   ```json
   {
       "user_id": "unique_user_id"
   }
   ```

## Code Structure
Here's an overview of the code structure and the purpose of each directory and file:

- **`src/`**: Main source code directory.
  - **`app.js`**: Main application file that initializes the Express server and sets up routes.
  - **`controllers/`**: Contains controller files that handle incoming requests.
    - **`taskController.js`**: Manages task requests, applying rate limiting and queueing.
  - **`queues/`**: Contains files related to the task queue.
    - **`taskQueue.js`**: Initializes the Bull queue and processes tasks.
    - **`taskFunction.js`**: Defines the function that logs task completion.
  - **`utils/`**: Contains utility files.
    - **`rateLimiter.js`**: Implements the rate limiting logic using Redis.
  - **`logs/`**: Directory for storing log files generated during task processing.

## Assumptions
- The Redis server is set up and accessible at the specified host and port in the `.env` file.
- The Node.js environment is properly configured and able to run the application.
- Unique user identifiers are provided in the request body for rate limiting.

## Testing Instructions
To test the application:

1. Ensure that the server is running and Redis is started.
2. Use Postman or `curl` to send multiple POST requests to `http://localhost:3000/task` with the same `user_id`.
3. Observe the responses. You should see:
   - `200 OK` for tasks that are accepted within the rate limit.
   - `429 Too Many Requests` for tasks that exceed the rate limit, with the message indicating that the task is queued.

4. Check the `logs/task_logs.txt` file to verify that all tasks are logged correctly, including those processed after exceeding the rate limit.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a robust approach to handling user tasks with rate limiting and queuing, ensuring that all requests are processed without dropping any, even under load. Adjust the rate limits and configurations in the `.env` file as needed to suit your use case.
